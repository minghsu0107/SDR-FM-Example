# SDR for FM Audio
This example service utilizes software-defined radio (SDR) to extract audio streams from FM radio broadcasts. It leverages the popular open-source `librtlsdr` library and related utilities like `rtl_fm` and `rtl_power` to interface with SDR hardware connected to the edge node. Specifically, it controls the tuning and data capture from the hardware to receive transmissions at specified frequencies. For example, it can tune to an FM station frequency, acquire the audio broadcast data, and then process it.

SDR shifts the radio signal processing like tuning and demodulation from specialized analog hardware to software running on a computer's digital CPU. This allows SDR to access a wider range of the radio spectrum than a traditional analog receiver locked to a single band like FM. If physical SDR hardware is not available, the service can use mock data that emulates a radio transmission, providing flexibility. So even without a real over-the-air signal, the service can ingest audio streams as if they were broadcast over FM radio.

For more information about the `librtlsdr` library and the `rtl_fm` usage, see [librtlsdr](https://github.com/librtlsdr/librtlsdr) and [Rtl_fm Guide](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/). Overall, this service exemplifies using SDR to acquire and process wireless signals at the edge.
## Side Note
The following shows the SDR receiving process for FM radio:
1. Radio stations broadcast FM signals centered around their carrier frequencies. These are double sideband (DSB) signals with the audio modulated onto both sidebands symmetrically around the carrier (center freq Â±75 kHz).
2. The SDR sensor first tunes to the desired station's frequency (e.g. 99.7 MHz). It also applies a bandpass filter centered on that frequency to select that station's signal and reject other stations.
3. The filtered signal is digitized, capturing the entire channel bandwidth (150 kHz) of the desired station.
4. A digital downconverter mixes this signal down to baseband, producing complex I/Q samples. This I/Q data represents the DSB signal centered at 0 Hz, with the audio modulated onto both sidebands.
5. An IQ demodulator processes the I/Q samples, taking the arctangent of Q/I to extract the upper or lower sideband. This converts the DSB signal to a single sideband (SSB) signal.
6. Apply FM demodulation: apply low pass filter (LPF) to SSB signal to remove carrier, leaving only the audio signal. The cutoff frequency of the LPF depends on the highest expected audio frequency. For FM radio audio, a cutoff around 15 kHz is typical.
7. Resample filtered audio to appropriate sample rate (eg. 32k Hz for stereo (2-channel) audio) using a digital resampler.

Why RTL-SDR hardware digitally downconverts the received FM signal to baseband I/Q samples rather than working with the original RF double sideband (DSB) signal?
1. Digital processing is easier at baseband: Operating on the I/Q samples at 0 Hz is simpler than trying to process the RF signal at the high carrier frequency. This avoids dealing with high sample rates.
2. Avoids analog demodulation circuits: Baseband I/Q sampling means FM demodulation can be done digitally rather than needing analog FM demod hardware.
3. Hardware simplicity: Only a tunable RF front-end and ADC are needed since demodulation is done in software.
## Install Dependencies
In order to extract raw data from the SDR hardware, the `librtlsdr` binaries have to be installed on the host machine.

First, have `gcc`, `g++`, and `make` installed. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential
```

Then install `cmake` and `libusb`.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

Next, build and install `librtlsdr` binaries and libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
After building and installing librtlsdr, the files are located in the following directories:
- Header files are installed to `/usr/local/include`
- Library files are installed to `/usr/local/lib`
- Executable binaries are installed to `/usr/local/bin`
### For Mac Users (Apple Chips)
Install  `cmake` and `libusb` via Homebrew.
```bash
brew install cmake libusb
```
Check the version and library paths of `libusb`.
```bash
brew ls libusb
```
Build and install the librtlsdr binaries and libraries, setting the appropriate configuration and library paths for the system. For example, on Mac M2 with `libusb` version `1.0.26`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR:STRING=arm64 -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libusb/1.0.26/include/libusb-1.0 -DLIBUSB_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/lib/libusb-1.0.dylib ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
Another example when using Mac M1 with `libusb` version `1.0.26`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR:STRING=arm64 -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/libusb/1.0.26/include/libusb-1.0 -DLIBUSB_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libusb-1.0.dylib ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
## Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t minghsu0107/rtlsdr-example-api .
```
## Getting Started
Start a `rtl_rpcd` daemon on the host machine, which allows remote access of SDR hardware at `127.0.0.1:40000` via `librtlsdr` command-line tools.

```bash
RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_ADDR=127.0.0.1 RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_PORT=40000 rtl_rpcd >> rtlrpcd.log 2>&1 &
```

Run the API server inside a container, which retrieves raw data remotely from the `rtl_rpcd` daemon on the host machine and exposes audio data via HTTP APIs:

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 -e RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_ADDR=host.docker.internal -e RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_PORT=40000 minghsu0107/rtlsdr-example-api
```
The API server is now configured to listen on port 8080 inside the container, which is forwarded from port 8080 on the host machine. This allows the API server to be accessed from the host machine at `http://localhost:8080`.
## APIs
### `/freqs`
Get a list of the frequencies of strong radio stations.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/freqs
```

Example response:

If the SDR hardware is present it will return a list of string FM stations.

`{"origin":"sdr_hardware","freqs":[89700000,91100000,91900000,93300000,94500000,95700000,96100000,97700000,99100000,101500000,102300000,103700000,105100000,107900000]}`

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason it will return a single station of frequency 0.

`{"origin":"fake","freqs":[0]}`

### `/audio/<freq>`
Get a 30 second chunk of raw audio.

```bash
# brew install sox
curl localhost:8080/audio/99700000 | play --rate 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
```

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason you can curl the fake station at frequency 0.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/audio/0 | play --rate 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
```
