# SDR for FM Audio
This example service utilizes software-defined radio (SDR) to extract audio streams from FM radio broadcasts. It leverages the popular open-source `librtlsdr` library and related utilities like `rtl_fm` and `rtl_power` to interface with SDR hardware connected to the edge node. Specifically, it controls the tuning and data capture from the hardware to receive transmissions at specified frequencies. For example, it can tune to an FM station frequency, acquire the audio broadcast data, and then process it.

SDR shifts the radio signal processing like tuning and demodulation from specialized analog hardware to software running on a computer's digital CPU. This allows SDR to access a wider range of the radio spectrum than a traditional analog receiver locked to a single band like FM. If physical SDR hardware is not available, the service can use mock data that emulates a radio transmission, providing flexibility. So even without a real over-the-air signal, the service can ingest audio streams as if they were broadcast over FM radio.

For more information about the `librtlsdr` library and the `rtl_fm` usage, see [librtlsdr](https://github.com/librtlsdr/librtlsdr) and [Rtl_fm Guide](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/). Overall, this service exemplifies using SDR to acquire and process wireless signals at the edge.

## Side Note
- Antenna Reception: The antenna captures the FM signal in the desired frequency range, typically around 88 to 108 MHz for FM radio broadcasts.
- RTL-SDR Dongle: The RTL-SDR dongle receives the RF (Radio Frequency) signal from the antenna. It digitizes this analog signal into digital samples, providing the I/Q (In-phase and Quadrature) data stream.
    - RTL-SDR devices commonly utilize I/Q sampling, which captures both the in-phase and quadrature components of a signal. This method captures a spectrum that includes both positive and negative frequencies around the center frequency.
    - In the case of an FM signal with a typical bandwidth of 200 kHz, I/Q sampling captures both the positive and negative frequency components within this bandwidth. This is why, with an RTL-SDR device using I/Q sampling, setting the sampling rate to match the signal bandwidth (200 kHz) covers the necessary spectrum to capture the entire FM signal (Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states that the sample rate must be at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to avoid aliasing distortion).
- Software Configuration: The user configures the SDR software on their computer. They specify the desired center frequency within the FM band (for instance, 98.5 MHz) and set the appropriate sampling rate, often matching or slightly exceeding the signal bandwidth.
- Data Processing: The software processes the incoming I/Q samples, which contain information about both the in-phase and quadrature components of the received signal.
- Filtering: Within the software, filtering techniques are applied to isolate the desired signal within the captured spectrum. Unwanted noise or adjacent signals may be filtered out to enhance the clarity of the target signal.
- Demodulation: The FM modulation within the I/Q data is demodulated to extract the audio information. This process involves interpreting changes in the frequency of the signal to retrieve the audio content.
- Audio Output: Once demodulated, the software provides an audio output. This audio can then be played through the computer's speakers or headphones, allowing the user to listen to the FM radio station.

## Install Dependencies
In order to extract raw data from the SDR hardware, the `librtlsdr` binaries have to be installed on the host machine.

First, have `gcc`, `g++`, and `make` installed. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential
```

Then install `cmake` and `libusb`.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

Next, build and install `librtlsdr` binaries and libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
After building and installing librtlsdr, the files are located in the following directories:
- Header files are installed to `/usr/local/include`
- Library files are installed to `/usr/local/lib`
- Executable binaries are installed to `/usr/local/bin`
### For Mac Users (Apple Chips)
Install  `cmake` and `libusb` via Homebrew.
```bash
brew install cmake libusb
```
Check the version and library paths of `libusb`.
```bash
brew ls libusb
```
Build and install the librtlsdr binaries and libraries, setting the appropriate configuration and library paths for the system. For example, on Mac M2 with `libusb` version `1.0.26`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR:STRING=arm64 -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libusb/1.0.26/include/libusb-1.0 -DLIBUSB_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/lib/libusb-1.0.dylib ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
Another example when using Mac M1 with `libusb` version `1.0.26`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minghsu0107/librtlsdr
cd librtlsdr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR:STRING=arm64 -DLIBUSB_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/libusb/1.0.26/include/libusb-1.0 -DLIBUSB_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libusb-1.0.dylib ../
sudo make && sudo make install
```
## Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t minghsu0107/rtlsdr-example-api .
```
## Getting Started
Start a `rtl_rpcd` daemon on the host machine, which allows remote access of SDR hardware at `127.0.0.1:40000` via `librtlsdr` command-line tools.

```bash
RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_ADDR=127.0.0.1 RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_PORT=40000 rtl_rpcd >> rtlrpcd.log 2>&1 &
```

Run the API server inside a container, which retrieves raw data remotely from the `rtl_rpcd` daemon on the host machine and exposes audio data via HTTP APIs:

```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 8080:8080 -e RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_ADDR=host.docker.internal -e RTLSDR_RPC_SERV_PORT=40000 minghsu0107/rtlsdr-example-api
```
The API server is now configured to listen on port 8080 inside the container, which is forwarded from port 8080 on the host machine. This allows the API server to be accessed from the host machine at `http://localhost:8080`.
## APIs
### `/freqs`
Get a list of the frequencies of strong radio stations.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/freqs
```

Example response:

If the SDR hardware is present it will return a list of string FM stations.

`{"origin":"sdr_hardware","freqs":[89700000,91100000,91900000,93300000,94500000,95700000,96100000,97700000,99100000,101500000,102300000,103700000,105100000,107900000]}`

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason it will return a single station of frequency 0.

`{"origin":"fake","freqs":[0]}`

### `/audio/<freq>`
Get a 30 second chunk of raw audio.

```bash
# brew install sox
curl localhost:8080/audio/99700000 | play --rate 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
```

If the SDR hardware is not present or can not be used for some reason you can curl the fake station at frequency 0.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/audio/0 | play --rate 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
```
